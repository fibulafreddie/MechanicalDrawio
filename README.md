# MechanicalDrawio
A repository dedicated to libraries for draw.io focusing on physics sketches, maths and technical drawings. 

'Geometry.xml' contains duplicates of already-existing 2D-figures in draw.io that have been found useful for sketching maths, physics and mechanical sketches. 
'Geometry3D.xml' Is the same, but for 3D figures.
'Mechanical.xml' contains duplicates and self-drawn figures, that may be imported for reuse. 

Pro-tip: Use 'ctrl + g' to group a figure, so that it may be scaled.

%% HOW TO %%
In draw.io/diagrams.net go to 'file' -> 'open library' and choose the appropriate library. You may now use all the figures it contains!

%% MAKE YOUR OWN CHANGES %%
Mark the awesome thing you've drawn and drag it into your library of choice. Click the save icon to save the .xml file so you can use the figure in different draw.io files.
